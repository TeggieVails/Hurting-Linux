# Hurting-Linux
Various .bashrc modifications to make your terminal experience more "enjoyable"

Let me start off by saying that I *do not* take responsibility for any damages caused by my scripts. The user is ultimately the end decision-maker for judging if this is a good idea or not. 

That being said, this will at least take up some time you may be bored at work and can slap down a save-state in a VM or want to learn about repairing Linux. I know it did for me.

Now on with the show...

**Do you hate Linux as much as I do? Do you want to make it suffer?**

# "Stop Hitting Yourself..."

Introducing my new line of .bashrc scripts that will do wacky stuff, all with the hope of panicking your kernel. The first of which is a speed-optimized version of RGBCube's self-harm Linux (https://github.com/RGBCube/selfharm-linux)!

Heavily modified and renamed to *Sparky's Self-Harm Linux*, every mistake will delete an important file in bin, etc, lib&lib64, and their respective folders in each usr folder.

New to programming, so any reccomendations will be very much appreciated, this seemed like a great way to get into development while doing the things I love, like making Linux cry.


# Installation

Installation is easy, simply append your .bashrc file (probably in ~, you can find it with 'ls -a /root') by typing 'sudo cat [WHATEVER_DOWNLOADED_NONSENSE] >>  ~/.bashrc' in the terminal. Don't worry, it won't always be like this. I may one day decide to program an installer/uninstaller.



## To do:
1. **CREATE AN INSTALLER/UNINSTALLER**
2. Alzheimers Linux: Commands' aliases will randomly change to a different word.
3. Russian Roulette Linux: 1/6 Chance your terminal commands will delete a file mentioned above, even when correct.
4. Commenter's Suggestions
