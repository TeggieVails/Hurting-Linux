# Hurting-Linux
Various .bashrc modifications to make your terminal experience more "enjoyable"

**Do you hate Linux as much as I do? Do you want to make it suffer?**

# "Stop Hitting Yourself..."

Introducing my new line of .bashrc scripts that will do wacky stuff, all with the hope of panicking your kernel. The first of which is a speed-optimized version of RGBCube's self-harm Linux (https://github.com/RGBCube/selfharm-linux)!

Heavily modified and renamed to Sparky's Self-Harm Linux, every mistake will delete an important file in bin, etc, lib&lib64, and their respective folders in each usr folder.

New to programming, so any reccomendations will be very much appreciated, this seemed like a great way to get into development while doing the things I love, like making Linux cry.


## To do:
1. **CREATE AN INSTALLER/UNINSTALLER**
2. Alzheimers Linux: Commands' aliases will randomly change to a different word.
3. Russian Roulette Linux: 1/6 Chance your terminal commands will delete a file mentioned above, even when correct.
